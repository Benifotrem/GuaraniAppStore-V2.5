The AI engineer's work spanned several critical areas: the completion and refinement of an Automated Blog System, iterative bug fixing, resolution of a major security vulnerability, and the initial implementation of new AI-driven crypto services. Key accomplishments include the successful integration and verification of  for blog image generation, comprehensive UI/UX improvements for blog display, and dynamic adaptation of backend services to operate robustly with MongoDB as a fallback when PostgreSQL was unavailable. A significant challenge involved addressing Git security failures due to exposed credentials, which was resolved by guiding the user through local Git history cleanup and ensuring  protection. The trajectory culminated in the structured implementation of the **Pulse IA** crypto sentiment analysis service, including its data scrapers, sentiment model, API, and Telegram bot integration, all while maintaining the flexible database approach. The next task was to scaffold the **Momentum Predictor IA** architecture.

The GuaraniAppStore V2.5 Pro is a full-stack application (FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL) offering 11 AI-driven business services, robust authentication, and a pixel-perfect landing page. A core requirement was an automated blog system to generate 7 SEO-optimized articles weekly (6 agent, 1 CEO), with AI-generated images and an admin approval workflow using APScheduler and PostgreSQL. This expanded to include on-demand article generation via an Admin Panel, specific rich-text formatting (floating images, author signatures, Bitfinex promotion), and a responsive UI. Additional requests included resolving session closure, adding Delete Account and Cancel Subscription features.

Later, the user requested the implementation of three complete crypto AI services:
1.  **Momentum Predictor IA**: LSTM-based trading signal prediction (BUY/SELL/HOLD), technical analysis, Telegram bot, REST API, and dashboard using Python (TensorFlow/Keras, CCXT, TA-Lib), FastAPI, React, and PostgreSQL.
2.  **CryptoShield IA**: Autoencoder-based fraud and scam detection on blockchain transactions, real-time alerts, wallet/contract analysis, Telegram bot, and REST API using Python (TensorFlow/Keras, web3.py, etherscan-python), FastAPI, and PostgreSQL.
3.  **Pulse IA**: Market sentiment analysis from 15+ RSS feeds, Twitter, and Reddit, with sentiment scores, trend detection, FOMO/FUD detection, Telegram bot, REST API, and dashboard using Python (Transformers/BERT, feedparser, tweepy, praw), FastAPI, React, and PostgreSQL.

These new services require specific external API keys (Telegram Bot, Etherscan, Twitter, Reddit) and PostgreSQL for data storage, though an adaptation for MongoDB was implemented for immediate functionality due to PostgreSQL availability issues.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the architectural setup for the **Pulse IA** crypto sentiment analysis service. This included creating all necessary backend Python files for RSS, Twitter, and Reddit scrapers (, , ), the core sentiment analysis () and service logic (), its dedicated Telegram bot (), and a REST API (). These components were integrated into the main  and tested for basic functionality. The system successfully performed RSS scraping and sentiment analysis, and its API health check endpoint returned healthy. This work was done by adapting to a MongoDB-only environment for these services due to PostgreSQL's recurring unavailability.

Concurrently, there was a critical security incident where sensitive API keys were found in Git history. The AI engineer initiated a multi-step remediation process:
1.  Obfuscated all identified keys in  and .
2.  Updated  to explicitly prevent , , and other potential secret files from being tracked.
3.  Executed a local Git history cleanup by reinitializing the repository and adding all files to a fresh commit to ensure no historical commits contained secrets.
4.  Provided the user with a detailed explanation of the problem and the steps taken.

The last explicit request from the user was to proceed with the **Momentum Predictor IA**, but only to create its architecture without training the model. The AI engineer has initiated this by creating the placeholder files for its LSTM model, preprocessor, prediction service, API, and Telegram bot.
