The AI engineer's work focused on two main areas: implementing a comprehensive Automated Blog System and resolving various critical user-reported issues and bugs across the application. The blog system involved extensive backend development (database models, FastAPI endpoints for generation, approval, and statistics) and a detailed frontend (Admin Panel, article generation form, preview, and public blog display with specific styling and content formatting). Iterative debugging resolved persistent CSS loading, backend syntax errors, and ensured correct rendering of AI-generated content (floating images, rich text, author signatures, Bitfinex promotion). Concurrently, UX improvements like session persistence, Delete Account, and Cancel Subscription features were implemented. A Google OAuth  error remains pending external user action. The immediate ongoing task is verifying AI-generated images using the newly configured  model.

<product_requirements>
The GuaraniAppStore V2.5 Pro is a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and PostgreSQL database, featuring a pixel-pixel landing page, JWT/OAuth authentication, and 11 AI-driven business services. A critical requirement is an automated blog system capable of generating 7 SEO-optimized articles weekly (6 agent, 1 CEO), with AI-generated images and an admin approval workflow, using APScheduler and PostgreSQL. This expanded to include on-demand article generation via an Admin Panel, specific UI/UX designs, and detailed content formatting such as rich text, floating images, author signatures, and a Bitfinex affiliate call-to-action. Additional requirements encompassed resolving session closure issues, adding a Delete Account button in the user profile, and implementing a Cancel Subscription system in the transactions section.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Updated to define the  SQLAlchemy ORM model, including extensive fields for content, author, SEO metadata, publishing status, and a detailed approval workflow (e.g., , ).
-   ****: Expanded with Pydantic models (, ) for robust data validation and serialization, crucial for the new blog system's API.
-   ****: This new service handles the core logic for AI-driven article and image generation using OpenRouter. It manages prompt engineering for rich text formatting, author signatures, Bitfinex promotion, dynamic image insertion based on article content, and agent detection.
-   ****: A new service using APScheduler to automate the generation of scheduled blog articles, invoking .
-   ****: Significantly refactored to integrate new FastAPI endpoints for the blog's administration (e.g., , , ). It also manages application startup/shutdown events to control the blog scheduler and includes new endpoints for user account deletion and subscription cancellation. Fixes were made to handle database session context correctly.
-   ****: Modified to expose both asynchronous () and synchronous () session factories, accommodating various database interaction patterns required by the backend.
-   ****: A newly created utility file consolidating all API interactions related to the blog system from the frontend (e.g., , , ).
-   ****: Modified to incorporate a Blog navigation tab, which dynamically renders the  component, enabling administrative access to the blog features.
-   ****: A new page serving as the main administrative dashboard for the blog. It displays blog statistics, lists articles awaiting approval, and hosts the .
-   ****: A dedicated page for managing pending articles, allowing administrators to review, preview, and either approve or reject generated content.
-   ****: Completely overhauled to display public blog articles. It now features a responsive 4-column grid layout, enhanced visual styling, and utilizes  with  to correctly render rich, AI-generated content including floating images and author signatures.
-   ****: Rewritten to ensure proper loading and application of styles for the public blog, implementing the grid layout, card designs, hover effects, and responsive adjustments for a professional appearance.
-   ****: A new React component providing a form for administrators to generate articles on demand, allowing specification of search queries, keywords, agent, tone, and length.
-   ****: A new component displaying a concise summary of an article in the approval queue, including title, author, request details, and action buttons.
-   ****: A modal component that presents a full, formatted preview of a generated article, including metadata and rendered markdown content, before final approval.
-   ****: Updated to remove automatic redirection to the dashboard for logged-in users, ensuring they can access the landing page. It dynamically hides trial-related call-to-action buttons when a user is authenticated.
-   ****: Enhanced to include a Danger Zone section within the user profile tab, featuring a Delete Account button. The transactions tab was also modified to include a Cancel Subscription button for active subscriptions.
-   ****: Modified to dynamically change the Iniciar SesiÃ³n button to ðŸŽ¯ Ir al Dashboard when a user is logged in, improving navigation consistency.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's explicit request to update the AI image generation model for the automated blog system. The user requested to use  via OpenRouter. The  file has been updated to specify this model for image generation, and the backend has been restarted. A new article generation process has been initiated to test this change, and the system is currently in the process of generating this article. This work follows extensive refinements to the blog system's UI/UX, content formatting (titles, paragraphs, floating images, author signatures), and functionality, ensuring articles appear correctly on the public blog page and within the admin panel, as well as several critical bug fixes related to user session persistence and account management features.
