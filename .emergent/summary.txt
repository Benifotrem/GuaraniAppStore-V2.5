The AI engineer's work progressed through distinct phases: first, implementing the Momentum Predictor IA, including dependency installation, backend integration, and API testing. This was followed by the CryptoShield IA implementation, covering dependency installation, file creation, backend integration, and API testing. A significant mid-trajectory task involved updating the landing page to match a real site in terms of products, pricing, and availability, which led to extensive frontend and backend modifications, including database service updates. The engineer also debugged frontend compilation errors related to JSX syntax. The trajectory culminated with the user identifying inconsistencies in authentication and requesting dedicated client and admin dashboards, prompting the engineer to begin implementing a global  and initial dashboard structures. Throughout, the engineer demonstrated adaptability (e.g., changing crypto exchanges due to geo-blocking, debugging frontend issues) and adherence to the user's evolving requests.

The GuaraniAppStore V2.5 Pro is a full-stack (FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL) application featuring 11 initial AI services, authentication, and a landing page. Core features included an automated blog system for 7 weekly SEO-optimized articles with AI images and an admin approval workflow, later expanded to on-demand generation with rich-text formatting. The user subsequently requested three crypto AI services: **Momentum Predictor IA** (LSTM-based trading signals, Telegram bot, REST API), **CryptoShield IA** (Autoencoder-based fraud detection, real-time alerts, Telegram bot, REST API), and **Pulse IA** (Market sentiment analysis from various sources, Telegram bot, REST API). These required specific external API keys and primarily PostgreSQL, with a MongoDB fallback. A later critical request was to align the application's landing page content, services, pricing, and promotions precisely with an existing real site (guaraniappstore.com), which presented significantly different product offerings and pricing structures. Finally, the user requested a robust client dashboard and an admin dashboard to manage services and address authentication inconsistencies.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with resolving inconsistencies in authentication and creating client and admin dashboards. The engineer has begun this work by implementing foundational elements for improved authentication and navigation:
1.  **Created **: A new file at  to centralize authentication state and logic across the React frontend.
2.  **Created **: A new file at  for the dedicated client-facing dashboard.
3.  **Created **: A new file at  for the administrative dashboard.
4.  **Initiated  update**: The next step is to update  to integrate the newly created  and define the routes for  and , ensuring consistent navigation and authentication state management.
This work directly addresses the user's explicit request to fix authentication and provide dedicated dashboards.
